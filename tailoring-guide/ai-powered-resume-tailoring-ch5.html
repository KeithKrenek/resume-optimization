<li><strong>Thou Shalt Keep Learning:</strong> Stay updated on the latest AI tools and techniques. Today's cutting-edge tool could be tomorrow's digital dinosaur.</li>
<li><strong>Thou Shalt Protect Thy Data:</strong> Be cautious about the personal data you input into AI tools. Ensure you're comfortable with the tool's data usage policies. You don't want your resume to be the start of a "data breach" movie plot.</li>
<li><strong>Thou Shalt Balance Automation and Personalization:</strong> While AI can generate much of your resume content, ensure your unique voice and experiences shine through. You're aiming for "Iron Man in the suit," not "Ultron took over my LinkedIn."</li>
