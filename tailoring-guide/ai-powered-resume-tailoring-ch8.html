<img src="figs/8a.png" alt="Future Trends in AI and Resume Tailoring" class="image"/>
<h2>A. Emerging Technologies in Hiring and Resume Screening: When Your Resume Becomes Smarter Than You</h2>
<h3>1. Advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP): The Resume Whisperer</h3>
<div class="future-trend">
<h4>The Trend: Hyper-contextual understanding of resume content</h4>
<p>Imagine an AI so smart, it not only reads between the lines of your resume but also reads between the spaces between the lines.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>AI will understand your achievements better than your mom does.</li>

</div>
<div class="stem-application">
<h4>STEM Application: Your Skills, Now with Futureproofing</h4>

<p>Interesting... not sure what else to say.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Decreased importance of the resume as a standalone document. Your LinkedIn profile, GitHub repos, and that tech blog you started but abandoned after two posts all become part of your application.</li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="stem-application">
<h4>STEM Application: Your Code Commits, Now Part of Your Resume</h4>
<p>Evaluation of your coding activity on platforms like GitHub alongside traditional resume content. Your late-night bug fixes are finally getting the recognition they deserve.</p>

</div>
<h3>4. Dynamic, Real-Time Resume Customization: Your Resume, Now with Shape-Shifting Powers</h3>
<div class="future-trend">
<h4>The Trend: AI systems that adjust resume content in real-time based on the reader's interests</h4>
<p>It's like having a resume with ESP, reading the mind of whoever's viewing it and showing them exactly what they want to see.</p>
<p><strong>Potential Impact:</strong></p>
