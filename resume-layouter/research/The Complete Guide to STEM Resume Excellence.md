The single-column layout uses standard section headers ("Work Experience," "Education," "Skills") with consistent formatting throughout. Typography relies on universally compatible fonts (Arial, Calibri) in standard sizes (10-12pt body, 14-16pt headers).

**Technical implementation features:**
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsonresume/resume-schema/v1.0.0/schema.json",
  "meta": {
    "theme": "ats-minimalist",
    "template": "single-column",
    "optimizations": ["keyword-density", "standard-headers", "simple-formatting"]
  }
}
```

**HTML/CSS structure** emphasizes semantic markup with minimal styling:
```css
.resume-minimalist {
  font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.4;
  max-width: 8.5in;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.section-header {
  font-size: 14pt;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 8pt;
  border-bottom: 1pt solid #000;
}

@media print {
  .resume-minimalist {
    font-size: 11pt;
  }
}
```

**Content strategy** focuses on exact keyword matching from job descriptions, with achievements framed using the WHO methodology (What, How, Outcome). Each experience bullet includes specific technologies and quantified results: "Built scalable microservices architecture using Node.js and Docker, reducing server response time by 40% and supporting 10M+ daily active users."
